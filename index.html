        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>
            There are only so many hours in a day, and I think I’ve managed to fill all 30 of them. <br><br>

            My life and career have revolved around problem solving in one capacity or another. There is
            something supremely satisfying in that moment, after nearly imploding in frustration, when
            everything just … clicks.<br><br>

            First and foremost, as a husband of 23 years, and father of many wonderful children, ranging
            from post college to attending to not-sure-she-wants-to-be-yet, on down to my youngest, who
            has shown us how to meet every challenge with enthusiasm. <br><br>

            For twenty years, I labored in various forms of residential, commercial, and industrial building
            construction/ renovation. From installing windows, to tile, to foundation work, all the way to
            building a home and shipbuilding, nothing is ever as straightforward as the engineers drew it up. <br><br>

            More recently I have worked as both an Electrician and Maintenance Technician in the shipyard industry,
            servicing our nation’s Navy and Amphibious Forces. Currently, I am serving as Lockout Tagout
            Technician as well as Work Authorization Form Coordinator. <br><br>

            Throughout my career, I’ve demonstrated an ability to work with teams and individuals across disciplines
            as well as been trusted to work independently with little or no oversight. I have filled many roles at
            various times as a:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Production Team Leader </li>
            <li>Lead Mechanic </li>
            <li>Mentor and Tutor </li>
            <li>Sole Proprietor, and Business Partner</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <br>
            I have recently earned a degree in Computer Programming through remote classes at College of the Albemarle,
            including studies in Visual Basic, Databases, and Information Systems. <br><br>

            My free time, what’s left after a 48-hour work week, family, and studies, is spent exploring C# and building
            small projects to further my skills and understanding. <br><br>
